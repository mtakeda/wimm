# wimm

We are in quarantine. 

And, if you are like me, you're working with thousand of opened tabs and windows at same time. One of those windows is an endless meeting with your boss. You ~~don't care about it~~ are listening carefully while working in another window and, suddenly, someone calls you. Where is my meeting?! How to find the window fast to unmute and answer the boss?

Where is my meeting (a.k.a. wimm) is a Chrome plugin to allow you bring your meeting window to foreground faster and let you boss _know_ you were always there.
